# launching the game
### you'd need
1. node js
2. midi files (.mid)

### steps
1. clone this repo
2. open the repo in a terminal
3. `npm i && npm run dev`

# keybinds
`space` to open file picker to choose a .mid file then play
`1` to increase note speed
`2` to decrease note speed
`3` to toggle auto
`backspace` to retry the song

almost every key will be used so watch out.

# maps?
you'd need to find .mid files for the song you want to play, I haven't tested the this much, as it is a 1 week school project.
you can mostly find these midi files on onlinesequncer or musescore (with either tampermonkey or extension for downloading songs for free)
songs with multiple tracks might not work.
